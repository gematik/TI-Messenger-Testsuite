    ## REST interface to automate the test of a TI-Messenger client implementation.
    
    This API contains all endpoints for version 1.1.x and version 2 (TIM Pro & TIM ePA) of the TI-Messenger. The tags named accordingly can be used to find the endpoints applicable for the desired version.
    Additionally each endpoint summary will contain a note describing whether the endpoint is used by an org-admin, a client or both.

        Implementation is no longer optional! Testsuite sends a request to the involved test driver endpoints.
        The org-admins will also be triggered, if they are not declared in the feature-file, they will be retrieved based on the homeservers of the clients involved in the test case.
        There will be no claiming attempt before these endpoints are triggered.
        The test case will start only after a successful response is received.
        This is an opportunity to clean user/rooms/FHIR-VZD etc.
        If the endpoint does not return a successful status code, the testsuite will not proceed.
