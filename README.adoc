[TIP]
====
TI-Messenger will start having biweekly forums ðŸŽ‰

First kick-off will happen Friday the 19th September.
We will give a short overview over the published example report and the certificate revocation list.

To sign up, visit our link:https://fachportal.gematik.de/veranstaltungen[Fachportal].

Although most of the questions and answers will probably be in German, information concerning the test suite will be presented in English.
We're happy to take questions in either language.

== About

The TI-Messenger-Testsuite is testing TI-Messenger instances via a https://github.com/gematik/TI-Messenger-Testsuite/blob/main/src/main/resources/api/TiMessengerTestTreiber.yaml[test driver interface] against each other.

Focus of the test suite is testing the interoperability between different TI-Messenger instances.
In depth information about set-up and test are documented
link:doc/userguide/Testsuite.adoc[here].

The test suite uses https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] and https://github.com/gematik/app-Tiger[Tiger] for the execution of https://serenity-bdd.github.io/[Serenity-BDD] tests.

For test execution a list of link:src/test/resources/combine_items.json[test instances] will be compiled into a list of test combinations using our link:https://github.com/gematik/cucumber-test-combinations-maven-plugin[maven plugin].
This filtered combination list will then be used in the tests of the   link:src/test/resources/templates[cucumber templates].

=== Release information

In link:ReleaseNotes.md[ReleaseNotes.md] all information about our (newest) releases can be found.

== Usage

The test suite runs the tests as maven integration tests.
After initial configuration the tests can be run with the command `mvn verify`.
More details about the necessary configuration before the first run can be found in link:doc/userguide/GettingStarted.adoc[GettingStarted].
Additional configuration possibilities are described in link:doc/userguide/DevGuide.adoc[DevGuide].

After test execution the test report and additional information can be found at link:target/site/serenity/index.html[target/site/serenity/index.html].
