and merging a pull request.

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to
open a PR with a fix.

### Coding Style

gematik projects follow the [google style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) conventions. Please follow them
when working on your contributions.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request Process

- When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- To open a PR
  please [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
  When you are making changes, it is recommended that you create
  a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
  for this purpose, based off of the main branch. After your changes are pushed back to your forked
  repository, you can then create a pull request from there.
- Fill the pull request template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers to understand your changes
  as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget
  to [link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.
- Update the [README.adoc](./README.adoc), the documentation and the [ReleaseNotes.md](./ReleaseNotes.md) with all
  details to document the changes made by this PR.
- Increase the version numbers in any necessary files and the [readme](./README.adoc) to the new version that this
  Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
- Once you submit your PR, a project team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional
  information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either
  using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in
  your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation
  as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
  do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Your PR is merged!
